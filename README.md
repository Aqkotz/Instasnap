# Instasnap

Instasnap is a very simple, yet very cool vizualisation of DALI Lab team members that helps organize people into teams within an organization. Just drag and drop the tiles to sort them into teams!

Completed for Dartmouth DALI Lab application F20.

To install, download the zip. Run `npm install react` inside the folder, then `npm start`.
